A PHP program to compress, encrypt, and hide messages inside of PNG files.

[For those of you who would rather use JavaScript](https://github.com/jspark311/node-bury).

Write up is at my [blog](http://www.joshianlindsay.com/index.php?id=126).

Comments and issues posted on github will be answered. Pull-requests are always welcome if you've fixed or enhanced something.

--------

Class source is well commented. The form.php file is the test fixture that the user interacts with, but it is not required. The class is stand-alone.
The test fixture is mostly valuable as a usage example, as all of the class's major features are broken out into options.



### Additionally
---
  * There must be a directory with the appropriate permissions named uploads in the same folder as form.php

  * GD must be installed and enabled

  * Mcrypt must be installed and enabled
