========================

A PHP program to compress, encrypt, and hide messages inside of PNG files.

Write up is here:

Comments and issues posted on github will be answered.

Class source is well commented. The form.php file is the test fixture that the user interacts with, but it is not required. The class is stand-alone.
The test fixture is mostly valuable as a usage example, as all of the class's major features are broken out into options.

Class and Form are both [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/) license, so be free.
